# My Odin Project Journey
- A Friend of mine who's Kenyan but currently In German continuing her studies in Urban Development and was interested in Coding in <b><i>Python</i></b> and asked for my recommendation given my experience and the fact that I have a <b><i>Bachelors of Science in Software Development</i></b>. Well I gave her a book that I thought was best for Python for her case to help her in Data Analysis. <b>She found it Usefull</b>
-  So she came back and asked if I've ever heard of <b><i>THE ODIN PROJECT</i></b>, and honestly I didn't, <b>I'VE NEVER SEEN HER THAT <i>MAD</i> AND <i>DISAPPOINTED</i></b> so I decided to look for it and Do it.
-  I'm doing it for Her because nothing here is new to me🤗🤗🤗, After all I'm sure I'll find something new that will be worth It.
